# discord-anti-link-system
This Code denies all Discord invite links that get sent into your Server! It also includes Player Permissions, which make it so if someone has a specific Permision e.g., MANAGE_MESSAGES, they can send links, but no one else can. This can be changed of course.

To Use this Code, you need to do `npm i regex` to download the regex dependecy. Once you have done that, and added the code into your index.js (or main file), it will now block all invites. Very simple to use, hope you guys enjoy it!
